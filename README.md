# kontti
Arduino / Windows IoT Core 10 and Azure Functions code for automatic plant growing environment system.

The project files are bit of a mess at the moment. Project is coded using Visual Studio and the main solution file is kontti.sln.

There is alot of small test solutions, but main solutions are: C# kontti and Arduino KonttiArduino.ino

I use Visual Micro Arduino IDE for Visual Studio, which is excellent compared to basic Arduino IDE: http://www.visualmicro.com/

More info coming soon :)
